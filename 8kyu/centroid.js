// The medians of a triangle are the segments that unit the vertices with the midpoint of their opposite sides. The three medians of a triangle intersect at the same point, called the barycenter or the centroid. Given a triangle, defined by the cartesian coordinates of its vertices we need to localize its barycenter or centroid.
// The function bar_triang() or barTriang or bar-triang, receives the coordinates of the three vertices A, B and C  as three different arguments and outputs the coordinates of the barycenter O in an array [xO, yO]
// This is how our asked function should work: the result of the coordinates should be expressed up to four decimals, (rounded result).
function barTriang(p1, p2, p3) {
    let x0 = (p1[0] + p2[0] + p3[0]) / 3;
    x0 = parseFloat(x0.toFixed(4));
    let y0 = (p1[1] + p2[1] + p3[1]) / 3;
    y0 = parseFloat(y0.toFixed(4));
    return [x0, y0];
